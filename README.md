Week 7 Update
-------------

- Write BNF(-esque) code for simulation description language files and create two or three examples that contain all the different parts of this

- Convert project proposal into README.md. Flesh out the hand-waved parts from my notes, or at least insert obvious "TODO"s.

- Finish github busywork, e.g., repo setup, license, etc.

√ Determine interaction command given from the "activity line" of display

√ Once the interface has been determined, I'll be programming to it.

- Get something on the screen. I'm using cl-charms as an ncurses equivalent, and I want to make sure it works (on my computer, at least), so a simple program that blinks a word or writes in the corners of the screen is fine enough to start with confidence.

√ Outline the entire program in high-level code without implementation.
